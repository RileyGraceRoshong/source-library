## Policing Efficacy

*   [Goldstein et al. 18](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/YOU_policing.pdf)
    *   Police departments that collect **more in fees** and fines are **less effective** at solving crimes
    *   “Specifically, we find that a **1 percent increase** in the share of own-source revenues from fees, fines, and forfeitures collected by a municipality is associated with a **decrease** in the violent crime clearance rate of **3.7 percentage points**”
        *   This relationship is proven through a variety of empirical strategies, the details of which are outlined extensively on the methodology
