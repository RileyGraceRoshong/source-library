## Policing Efficacy

*   [Goldstein et al. 18](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/YOU_policing.pdf)
    *   Police departments that collect **more in fees** and fines are **less effective** at solving crimes
    *   “Specifically, we find that a **1 percent increase** in the share of own-source revenues from fees, fines, and forfeitures collected by a municipality is associated with a **decrease** in the violent crime clearance rate of **3.7 percentage points**”
        *   This relationship is proven through a variety of empirical strategies, the details of which are outlined extensively in the methodology

   * Militerization of the police **does not** enchance safety of reduce crime
   * *"Militarized “special weapons and tactics” (SWAT) teams are more often deployed in communities of color, and—contrary to claims by police administrators—provide no detectable benefits in terms of officer safety or violent crime reduction, on average"*
   * However, militarized police in the news *does* increase negative attitudes towards law enforcement, demonstrating that police militerization is ultimately counterproductive
