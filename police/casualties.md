*   [BMJ Journals Injury Prevention: Miller et al. 17](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27)
    *   Analyzed 12.3 million police interventions
    *   **1,000 deaths** (2016)
    *   **1 in 291 stops/arrests** resulted in hospital-treated injury or death of a suspect or bystander
    *   **55,400 people were injured or killed** by cops during legal stop and search incidents in one year
*   [Criminal Legal News: Zoukis 18](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/mar/16/cops-killed-100-times-more-americans-terrorists-did-2017/)
    *   Cops Killed **100 Times** More Americans Than Terrorists Did in 2017 (1,000 people)
*   FTP puts some stats in perspective:
    *   [FTP](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/you-are-47-times-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-cop-than-by-an-islamic-terrorist/): you are **47 times as likely** to be killed by a cop than by an Islamic extremist
    *   [FTP](https://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-killed-450-citizens-mass-shootings/): In three years (2015-2017),  cops have killed **450% more citizens** than **four decades** of mass shootings
*   [Criminal Legal News: Chappell 18](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/jun/16/doj-police-shooting-family-dogs-has-become-epidemic/)
    *   The DOJ estimates that around **25 to 30** dogs are killed by cops **every day**, with some numbers as high as 10,000 per year.
    *   The totals **could be higher** -- most police agencies do not formally track officer-involved shootings involving animals.
