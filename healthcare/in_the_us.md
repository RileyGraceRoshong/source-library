## Healthcare in the U.S.

#### U.S. lags behind developed countries on a number of metrics in regards to healthcare, especially in terms of cost-efficiency and effectiveness

*   [OECD 18](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)
    *   **U.S. spends a lot more government money on healthcare per capita than developed countries** that have more successful healthcare systems
    *   _Note: an [version](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640905968686727169/unknown.png) of the data said that voluntary healthcare spending in the U.S. was disproportionately high, but that version is outdated_

    *   U.S. has spent more than other developed countries when it comes to healthcare, and **that gap has widened over time**

* [U.S. Census Bureau 18](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.html)
    * *"In 2018, **8.5 percent of people**, or **27.5 million**, did not have health insurance at any point during the year."*
    * *"The uninsured rate and number of uninsured increased from 2017 (7.9 percent or 25.6 million)."*
* [Commonwealth Fund: Collins et al. 19](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/feb/health-insurance-coverage-eight-years-after-aca)
    * **45%** of U.S. adults ages 19 to 64 are inadequately insured
    * This is nearly the same as in 2010, indicating nearly no imovement
    * The survey also includes a methodology that explains the qualifications for being underinsured
*   [Gagnon 08](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001)
    *   Finds that in the USA, **pharmaceutical companies spend almost twice as much on promotion as they do on R&D**. These numbers clearly show how promotion predominates over R&D in the pharmaceutical industry, contrary to the industry's claim.
