## Detransitioners

#### While detransitioning is rare in the first place, it is overwhelmingly driven by various forms of descrimination, not uncertainty with regards to identity.

    *   “De-transitioned” is defined as having “gone back to living as [one’s] sex assigned at birth, **at least for a while**.” 
        *   Note that this isn’t just about people who detransition **permanently**, it also includes people who, socially or medically, reverted their transition **temporarily**.
    *   Under this broad definition, **only 8%** of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point.
    *   Of these “detransitioners,” **only 5%** did it because they realized it was not for them, accounting for a **mere 0.4% of the overall sample.**
    *   Other, more prominent reasons include:
        *   Pressure from a parent (36%)
        *   Discrimination and harassment after beganing to transition (31%)
        *   Trouble with getting a job (29%)
        *   Pressure from other family members (26%)
        *   Pressure from spouse or partner (18%)
        *   Pressure from an employer (17%)
        *   Pressure from friends (13%)
        *   Pressure from a mental health professional (5%)
        *   Pressure from a religious counselor (5%)
        *   Financial reasons (3%)
        *   Medical reasons (2%)
*   Note about the survey report:
