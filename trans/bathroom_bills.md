    *   Analysis indicates there is **no empirical evidence to support these concerns**; such crimes & privacy violations are **exceedingly rare**. Calls for trans bathroom bills are **fear mongering**, plain and simple.

    *   A vast majority of cis women are not, in fact, concerned about which facilities transgender people use.

    *   This one excludes the "neither comfortable nor uncomfortable" answer which was **another 14%** from the 2017 survey
