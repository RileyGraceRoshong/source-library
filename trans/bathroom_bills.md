## Bathroom Bills

#### Evidence for the public safety argument in regards to bathroom bills is unsubstantiated in data.



*   [Hasenbush et al. 19](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z)
    *   **Analysis of crime & privacy violations** as they relate to concerns raised by those who advocate for ‘**trans bathroom bills**’
    *   Analysis indicates there is **no empirical evidence to support these concerns**; such crimes & privacy violations are **exceedingly rare**. Calls for trans bathroom bills are **fear mongering**, plain and simple.

    *   A vast majority of cis women are not, in fact, concerned about which facilities transgender people use.
    *   "**72% of women** said that they were “**very**” or “**quite comfortable**” with a transgender woman using a "female toilet"
    *   This one excludes the "neither comfortable nor uncomfortable" answer which was **another 14%** from the 2017 survey

    *   Non-academic source with liberal leanings; nonetheless legitimate findings
    *   Organization contacted officials at the largest school districts in **12 states** with gender identity protections on the books
    *   School districts were asked if there were “any incidences of harassment or inappropriate behavior” as a result of “allowing transgender students to access facilities they're comfortable with.”
    *   **0 school districts** (which represent over **600,000 students**) have had any increase incidents of harassment or inappropriate behavior after the law passed
*   **Specific Debunks:**
    *   **[Colorado high school incident](https://archive.is/hIE44)** - claimed that a trans woman was harassing other girls in a high school bathroom
        *   [Debunk](https://thinkprogress.org/anti-lgbt-group-admits-it-invented-story-about-transgender-student-harassing-classmates-updated-d66f40c01517/) - an interview with the school’s superintendent confirms that this never happened
    *   **[Joey Salads experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHt7EBCgJnI)** - Salads dresses up how he thinks a trans woman would, and goes into a women’s restroom, receiving negative responses from others in the scene
        *   [[Video] Debunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxoXcQbrGQs) - Salads misrepresented the behaviour of trans women and used a single-person restroom, so his whole experiment was probably staged. A replication of the experiment got no negative responses from others in the scene
    *   **[Dallas incident](https://www.krbcnews.com/dallas-transgender-woman-caught-taking-pictures-of-underage-girls-at-target/)** - Trans women allegedly taking photos of children in women’s restrooms
