    *   Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have:
        *   **Normative** levels of **depression**
        *   **Minimal** elevations in **anxiety**
        *   **Lower rates** of **internalizing psychopathology** (a spectrum of conditions characterized by negative emotion) then non-socially transitioned people

    *   Helping trans individuals cope with harassment and rejection, particularly by drawing on social support, may **promote better mental health**, which could help **reduce suicidality** in this population.

    *   **Children who socially transition** report levels of depression and anxiety which **closely match** levels reported by **cisgender children**, indicating social transition massively decreases the risk factor of both.
