*   [Klein and Golub 16](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/lgbt.2015.0111)
    *   Family rejection linked to **suicide, drug use**, and overall detriments to health
    *    To cope with transgender-related discrimination:
    *   **42.3% of the sample reported a suicide attempt** 
    *   **26.3% reported misusing drugs or alcohol**
    *   _“After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status, **family rejection was associated with increased odds** of both behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of family rejection.”_

    *   A **META-ANALYSIS** of **42 peer-reviewed studies** that analyzed the links between family support and the health and well-being of LGBT youth
        *   **25 studies** found that accepting behavior by parents toward their children’s sexual orientation or gender identity is linked to the health and well-being of LGBT youth.
        *   The other **17 studies** found that family support in general (i.e. not necessarily in response to children’s sexual orientation or gender identity) is linked to the health and well-being of LGBT youth.
