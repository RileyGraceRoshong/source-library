    *   Gendered stereotypes were found to affect children’s perception of **gender and appropriate behavior** and proliferate through certain influences:
        *   Consumer products
        *   The Media
        *   Early childhood education
        *   Relationships with parents

    *   A study of Korean immigrant girls and gender stereotypes
        *   Subjects admired princesses based on beauty or singing voice while boys admired princes based on chivalry, courage, or actions. Combined with a tradition of female subservience in Korean culture, these young girls appeared to accept their disenfranchisement.
        *   Subjects perceived that a woman could not be President of the United States because a classroom poster depicted all-male presidents.

    *   Observed children between the ages of 3-5
    *   Children predicted parents would **consistently apply these stereotypes** as reflected by their approval or disapproval of children’s choices to play with **gender stereotyped or cross-gender toys.**
    *   As early as **3-5 years**, children **recognize stereotypes** about gendered play and subconsciously account for social disapproval
