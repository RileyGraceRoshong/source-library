    *   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Everything you need to know about puberty blockers</span> 
    *   Full-blown puberty is irreversible
    *   Taking a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, secretion of the sex hormones can be stopped and the onset of puberty suppressed so that the body does not develop secondary sex characteristics
    *   This has been **done safely for decades** to suppress sex hormones in children who develop too early, a condition known as precocious puberty. Suppressors have also been used to **treat endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and prostate cancer.**
    *   It was only in 2008 that the **Endocrine Society approved** puberty suppressors as a treatment for transgender adolescents **as young as 12 years old**. The Society, with members in more than 100 countries, has since declared that the intervention appears to be **safe and effective**.  In 2011 the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), also issued Standards of Care for the treatment of patients with gender dysphoria, **which include puberty suppression.**

    *   Smaller Dutch study on puberty blockers
    *   All 55 participants were **on par with or better than others their age** when it came to things like anxiety, depression and body image, and none of them expressed regret as adults about their transitions or the choice to delay puberty.
    *   Since puberty suppression is a **fully reversible medical intervention**, it provides adolescents and their families with time to explore their gender dysphoric feelings, and [to] make a more definite decision regarding the first steps of actual gender reassignment treatment at a later age

    *   **BIG** report on trans youth and transition
    *   Endorsed by the **Human Rights Campaign**, **American Academy of Pediatrics** & the **American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians** which affirms the validity of **transgender youth**, encourages **appropriate care and respect** for their transness and provides resources on how to do so.
    *   Outlines TYPES OF TRANSITION: hormone blockers are the **ONLY** treatment used on adolescents and are **COMPLETELY reversible**.
