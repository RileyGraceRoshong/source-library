    *   Meta-analysis covering prior research on **trans individuals’ performance in sports** and preexisting **sports policies** concerning trans people
    *   “There is no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals) have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition
        *   (includes cross-sex hormones, gender-confirming surgery)
    *   competitive sport policies that place restrictions on transgender people need to be considered and potentially revised.
    *   Additional findings show most sports policies are** not evidence-based** and trans individuals experience **substantial discrimination** from sports institutions.

    *   “Any athletic advantages a transgender girl or woman arguably may have as a result of her prior testosterone levels **dissipate after about one year** of estrogen therapy”
    *   “According to medical experts on this issue, the assumption that a transgender girl or woman competing on a women’s team would have a competitive advantage outside the range of performance and competitive advantage or disadvantage that already exists among female athletes is **not supported by evidence**.”
