    *   **ENORMOUS** meta-analysis on transgender people and the effect gender transition has on their mental health
    *   **Of 56 studies, 52 **indicated transitioning has a** positive effect** on the mental health of transgender people and **4** indicated it had **mixed or no results**.
    *   **ZERO** studies indicated gender transitioning has **negative results**
    *   **This pretty much ends the argument right here.**

    *   **ANOTHER** meta-analysis of **28** studies on transition and hormones
    *   Sex reassignment/hormonal improvements:
        *   **80%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **dysphoria**
        *   **78%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **psychological symptoms**
        *   **72%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **sexual function**
        *   overall quality of life was found to have increased significantly
    *   Lower quality evidence, see methodology. Still significant and helpful findings regardless.

    *   Longitudinal study on the **effectiveness of puberty suppression, hormones, and later sex reassignment surgery** on trans individuals in improving mental outcomes
    *   **Unambiguously positive results** - results indicate puberty suppression, support of medical professionals & SRS have markedly **beneficial outcomes** to trans individuals’ mental health and productivity.
    *   These indicators were “similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population”

    * *"A new study has confirmed that **transgender youth often have mental health problems** and that their depression and anxiety **improve greatly with recognition** **and treatment of gender dysphoria**"*

    *   Longitudinal meta-analysis which indicates **transgender people** have a **lower quality of life** than the general population.
    *   However, that quality of life **raises dramatically** with ‘**Gender Affirming Treatment**’, the nature of which is detailed extensively in-text.
