#### Some trans individuals neurologically reflect cisgender people of their desired gender, indicating a neurological component to their experiences.

    *   **BRAIN SCANS** show that (many) transgender individuals neurologically reflect their identity, not their assigned gender at birth.
        *   The study included both adolescent boys and girls with gender dysphoria and used magnetic resonance imaging (**MRI**) scans to assess brain activation patterns in response to a pheromone known to produce **gender-specific activity**.
        *   The pattern of brain activation in both transgender adolescent boys and girls more **closely resembled that of non-transgender** boys and girls of their desired gender.

_Writer’s note: this is for more of a transmed-focused argument. Better as an “even if” arg; you shouldn’t need to prove a biological basis for transness since gender is a mode of social identification_
