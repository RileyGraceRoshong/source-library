## Crime

#### Immigrants commit less crime than native citizens



*   [FEE: Nowrasteh 15](https://fee.org/articles/by-the-numbers-do-immigrants-cause-crime/)
    *   Census Data
        *   In 2010, **10.7** percent of native-born men aged 18-39 without a high school degree were incarcerated **compared to 2.8 percent** of Mexican immigrants **and 1.7 percent** of Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants.
        *   _“The disparity in incarceration rates has **existed for decades**… incarceration rates of the native-born were anywhere from **two to five times higher** than that of immigrants.”_
    *   Macro-Analysis
        *   **159 cities** at three dates between 1980 and 2000: crime rates and levels of immigration are **not correlated** (Ousey and Kubrin)
        *   **111 US cities** with populations of at least 5,000 Hispanics and found no statistically significant findings. (Martinez 2008)
        *   **150 Metropolitan Statistical Areas** (MSAs) and found that levels of recent immigration had a statistically significant downward effect on homicide rates but no effect on property crime rates. (Reid et al. 2005)
*   [American Immigration Council: Ewing et al. 15](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/criminalization-immigration-united-states)
    *   The violent crime rate **declined by 48%** and the property crime rate by **41%** during the period of 1990 to 2013, while the undocumented population **more than tripled** from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.
    *   Correlation =/= causation, but the seemingly negative relationship between immigration and crime certainly suggests that, at the very least, more immigrants will likely not bring an onslaught of crime
