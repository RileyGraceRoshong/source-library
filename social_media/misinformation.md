    *   Study examining the prevalence of fake news shared over facebook.
    *   “Conservatives were more likely to share articles from **fake news domains,**” which are examined thoroughly in the methodology.
    *   These domains, in 2016, were “largely pro-Trump in orientation”
    *   “On average, users **over 65** shared nearly **seven times** as many articles from fake news domains as the youngest age group.”

    *   Outlets amplified misinformation derived from Donald Trump’s Twitter more than **400 times** over the three-week period of the study -- a rate of 19 per day.
    *   **30% of the tweets** by major media outlets’ Twitter accounts about Trump remarks referenced a **false or misleading statement.**
    *   Nearly two-thirds of the time, the outlets **did not dispute** that misinformation.
