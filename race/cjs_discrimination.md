## Criminal Justice System Discrimination

#### POC are imprisoned longer and subject to minimum sentencing laws far more than white people: data indicates judge biases and institutional causes.

    *   Black men who commit **the same crimes** as white men receive federal prison sentences that are, on average, **nearly 20 percent longer**
    *   The black/white sentencing disparities are being driven in large part by “non-government sponsored departures and variances”
        *   This means that sentencing choices are **made by judges at their own discretion**.

    *   All other factors being equal, black offenders were **75 percent more likely** to face a charge carrying a **mandatory minimum sentence** than a white offender who committed the **same crime**.

    *   Whites and African Americans report **using and selling drugs at similar rates**, but African Americans go to prison for drug offenses at **higher rates** than whites
    *   In 2002, African Americans were admitted to prison for drug offenses at **10 times the rate of whites** in the largest population counties in the country.

    *   **Meta-analysis of 71 studies**
    *   “_Analyses indicate that **African-Americans generally are sentenced more harshly than whites**; the magnitude of this race effect is statistically significant but small and highly variable_”
        *   High variability is explained by differences in methodology between studies
