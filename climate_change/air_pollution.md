## Air Pollution

#### Air pollution, primarily caused by the same energy emission that harms the climate, has detrimental effects on public health, including premature death, lung disease, and cancer.



*   [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) - Air Pollution Impacts
    *   **Air pollution kills** an estimated **7 million people worldwide** every year (Millions in Asia and hundreds of thousands in Europe & the Americas)
    *   **9 out of 10 people** breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.
    *   **97% of cities** in low- and middle- income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet WHO air quality guidelines.
    *   **43% of all lung disease and lung cancer deaths** are attributable to **air pollution**. Air pollution causes 1.8 million deaths due to lung disease and cancer every year.
    *   As air quality declines, the risk of **stroke, heart disease, lung cancer**, and chronic and acute **respiratory diseases**, including asthma, increases.
*   [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/about/en/) - Air Pollution Causes
    *   Major outdoor **pollution sources** include vehicles, power generation, building heating systems, agriculture/waste incineration and industry.
    *   More than **3 billion people** worldwide rely on **polluting technologies** and fuels
    *   Air quality is **closely linked** to earthâ€™s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of **high CO2 emissions.**
    *   Some air pollutants such as ozone and black carbon are short-lived **climate pollutants** that greatly contribute to climate change and affect agricultural productivity.
