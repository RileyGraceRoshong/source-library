## Ice Loss

#### Ice loss is occuring rapidly on both poles

*   [European Environmental Agency 16](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/greenland-ice-sheet-3/assessment)
    *   **Greenland Ice Loss** from 1992 to 2015 was **3,600 Gigatonnes** (3,500,000,000,000,000 Kilograms)
    *   Contributed to global **sea level rise** by approximately **10 mm**; 
    *   **Antarctica loss** is **1,500 Gigatonnes** (1,500,000,000,000,000 Kilograms)
    *   Corresponds to approximately a **5 mm** global sea level rise since 1992.
    *   Model projections suggest **further declines** of the polar ice sheets in the future, but the uncertainties are large.
    *   The melting of the polar ice sheets is estimated to contribute up to **50 cm** of global sea level rise during the 21st century.
