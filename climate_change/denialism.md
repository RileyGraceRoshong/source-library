## Climate Change Denialism

*   [Petersen et al. 19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09959-4) 
    *   Study that extensively examines the permeation of climate contrarian influence throughout media
    *   “Contrarians are featured in **49% more media** articles than scientists.”
    *   *“When comparing visibility in mainstream media sources only, we observe just a 1% excess visibility, which **objectively demonstrates** the **crowding out** of professional sources by the proliferation of new media sources, many of which contribute to the production and consumption of **climate change disinformation** at scale.”*
*   [Benestad et al. 16](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5)
    *   Examines a selection of **38 papers which dispute anthropogenic climate change**
    *   Found that **these papers oftentimes had mistakes** in methodology, analysis, assumptions, etc.
        *   _“In many cases, shortcomings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics.”_

    *   Libertarian think tank keeps prominent sceptics on its payroll and relies on millions in funding from carbon industry
    *   Scheme includes **$100,000** for spreading the message in K-12 schools that "the topic of climate change is controversial and uncertain”’
    *   Not the most reliable information to tackle the issue of climate change misinformation: _“It was not possible to immediately verify the authenticity of the documents"_
