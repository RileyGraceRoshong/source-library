    *   Analyzing the effects of employee ownership (typically ESOPs, where workers gain a stake in their company and its stock)
    *   Data shows:
        *   **33% higher** income from wages
            *   _This holds true at all wage levels_
        *   **53% longer** median job tenure
            *   _5.2 years compared to 3.4 years_
    *   Employee owners also have access to an array of benefits at work including:
        *   flexible work schedules
        *   retirement plans
        *   parental leave
        *   tuition reimbursement

    *   **Analysis of a variety of studies on employee ownership**
    *   **Productivity** improves by an extra **4-5%** on average in the year an ESOP (employee stock ownership) is adopted, and the higher productivity level is maintained in subsequent years.
        *   This one-time jump is more than **twice the average** annual productivity growth of the U.S. economy over the past 20 years.
    *   Most studies find **higher organizational commitment** and identification under employee ownership, while studies are mixed between favorable and neutral findings on job satisfaction, motivation, and other behavioral measures.
