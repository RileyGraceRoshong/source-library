        *   shorter waist circumference
        *   lower body mass index
        *   better perceptions of better physical function

   * Nearby nature that people actually experience is beneficial to mental health
   * *"Of five neighborhood nature characteristics tested, vegetation cover and afternoon bird abundances were positively associated with a lower prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress."*
   * From cited: *"The positive association between birds, shrubs and trees and better mental health applied, even after controlling for variation in neighbourhood deprivation, household income, age and a wide range of other socio-demographic factors."*
   * This study also references several others which come to similar conclusions about the effects of various environmental factors on wellbeing.
