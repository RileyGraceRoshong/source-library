## Overpopulation

*   [United Nations](https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_Highlights.pdf) [(cited)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/17/worlds-population-is-projected-to-nearly-stop-growing-by-the-end-of-the-century/)
    *   **Overpopulation is a lie**
    *   _“The global fertility rate is expected to be **1.9 births** per woman by 2100, down from 2.5 today (replacement levels are  2.1)”_
    *   The UN cites the following reasons for slowing population growth:
        *   human development
        *   reductions in child mortality
        *   increased levels of **education** (in particular for women and girls)
        *   increased **urbanization**
        *   expanded access to **reproductive health-care services** (including for family planning)
        *   women’s empowerment and growing labour force participation
