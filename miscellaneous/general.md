    *   Sexual desire in trans people after HRT/SRS
    *   _“The majority of trans women reported a decrease in sexual desire after SRT, whereas the opposite was observed in trans men. Our results show a significant sexual impact of surgical interventions and both hormonal and surgical treatment satisfaction on the sexual desire in trans persons.”_
    * Some data in several of the trans subsections contradict this, so it's an interesting subject

    *   One example of incredibly skewed media focus
    *   The royal wedding received over **triple the media coverage** of Yemen in 2018
    *   Yemen has been called the “**worst humanitarian disaster**” by the United Nations
    *   Yemen received a grand combined total of **20 minutes** of coverage on the ABC, NBC, and CBS weekday evening news programs in 2018.
    *   This is compared to:
        *   a total of **71 minutes** that the three major networks devoted to the **British royal wedding**
        *   a total of **100 minutes** dedicated to the rescue of a dozen young cave explorers from flooding in Thailand

   * Study (n= 276) on self-promotion and narcissism on social media

      * *"Vulnerable narcissism is associated with insecurity and social withdrawal, while grandiose narcissism is linked to extraversion and an excessive admiration of one’s own physical attractiveness."*
