    *   Uses data from 1.2 million inventors from patent records linked to tax records
    *   Finds that **certain characteristics at birth** (gender, race, parents’ socioeconomic class) in addition to **certain environmental characteristics** (exposure to innovation-rich areas, living around innovators) **have a significant correlation with the likelihood of that person becoming an inventor later on in life**
    *   **Women and minorities are exposed less to relevant environmental factors**, explaining why they don’t innovate as much as white men

    *   In Europe, countries with functional safety nets (mainly in Scandinavia and Western Europe) perform better when it comes to innovation
