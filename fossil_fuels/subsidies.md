    *   The US government spends approximately **$20.5 billion** subsidizing the fossil fuel industry <sup>[1]</sup>
        *   $14.7 billion federal subsidies
        *   $5.8 billion state subsidies
    *   Subsidies:
        *   **prop up** the existing fossil fuel sector
        *   drive up fossil fuel **extraction and use**
        *   develop **domestic fossil fuel assets**
        *   represent an **obstacle to renewable energy** investment by artificially increasing the relative cost of renewable energy <sup>[2]</sup>
    *   If we got rid of fossil fuel subsidies, **almost half of all new US oil production would be unprofitable and thus left undeveloped <sup>[3]</sup>**
