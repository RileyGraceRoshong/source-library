    *   Arms sales **make conflict more likely**.
    *   Recipients of new weapons feel more confident about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others. 
    *   Arms sales can also **prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts** and **erode regional stability**
    *   Some cited studies:
        *   Sub-Saharan Africa study: *“arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased probability of war.’”*
        *   Africa study: *"Weapons imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and carnage.”*
