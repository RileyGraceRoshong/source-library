## Studies to Watch Out For

*   [Dhejne et al. 11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364939)
    *   **Commonly cited by transphobes** to indicate sexual reassignment surgery **harms trans people** and increases risk of suicide.
    *   This is **NOT** what the study says
        *   A study proving that SRS harms trans people would compare the wellbeing of post-SRS trans people to pre-SRS trans people, but this one uses **CIS** people as a control group
    *   The study merely demonstrates that trans people who have had SRS **still are a vulnerable population** compared to cis people, but NOT that their condition had been worsened by SRS.
    *   The head author, Cecilia Dhejne, is actually very trans positive herself, and describes her intent in publishing this study in [this AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). 
*   [Littman 18](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)
    *   **Commonly cited by transphobes** to indicate transness spreads socially, that exposure to trans material might encourage youth to be trans. **“Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria”** (ROGD).
    *   **BAD DATA**. This study polled **PARENTS, not the actual children**, and those polls were taken online, _and_ those sites were **biased by nature** - ‘_4thwavenow, transgendertrend, youthtranscriticalprofessionals_’.
    *   **Horrendously, pathetically inept data collection.** Anyone who cites this should **be laughed at.**
*   [Leinung et al. 18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944393/) sometimes cited as [this article](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2018/02/20/medicine-alone-does-not-completely-suppress-testosterone-levels-among-transgender-women/)
    *   **Bad data**: the study claims that hormonal therapy does not help reduce T levels to that pf a cis woman’s; however, the study uses the testosterone blocker known as spiro which prevents the body from acting on the testosterone rather then remove it from the blood, making the data useless
