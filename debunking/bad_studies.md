## Studies to Watch Out For

*   [Dhejne C et al. 11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364939)
    *   **Commonly cited by transphobes** to indicate sexual reassignment surgery **HARMS trans people**, increases risk of suicide.
    *   **BAD DATA**. Control group for post-transition trans individuals was CISGENDER people - **post-SRS trans participants weren’t compared to pre-SRS trans participants, they were compared to cis participants.** Methodology **DOES NOT PROVE** the intended point.
*   [Littman 18](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)
    *   **Commonly cited by transphobes** to indicate transness spreads socially, that exposure to trans material might encourage youth to be trans. **“Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria”** (ROGD).
    *   **BAD DATA**. This study polled **PARENTS, not the actual children**, and those polls were taken online, _and_ those sites were **biased by nature** - ‘_4thwavenow, transgendertrend, youthtranscriticalprofessionals_’.
    *   **Horrendously, pathetically inept data collection.** Anyone who cites this should **be laughed at.**
*   [Leinung et al. 18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944393/) sometimes cited as [this article](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2018/02/20/medicine-alone-does-not-completely-suppress-testosterone-levels-among-transgender-women/)
    *   **Bad data**: the study claims that hormonal therapy does not help reduce T levels to that pf a cis woman’s; however, the study uses the testosterone blocker known as spiro which prevents the body from acting on the testosterone rather then remove it from the blood, making the data useless
