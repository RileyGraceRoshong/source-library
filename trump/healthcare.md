## Trump on Healthcare

*   Under Trump’s healthcare plan, **14 million** more people would be **uninsured** ([CBO 2017](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf) / [CNBC 2017](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/13/cbo-says-millions-lose-health-insurance-under-gop-obamacare-replacement.html))
    *   In 2026, an estimated **52 million people would be uninsured**, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law ([CBO 2017](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf))
    *   **Premiums** would also increase by **15 to 20%** in the next few years, although they _would_ be 10% lower by 2026 ([CBO 2017](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf))
    *   _Note: most of these losses come from the elimination of the ACA’s individual mandate, which requires all people to purchase health insurance. While the ACA certainly has flaws in this respect, the Trump administration’s health care plan represents an inadequate solution with severe adverse effects on the populace._
