    *   A **META-ANALYSIS** of **47** peer reviewed studies on conversion therapy for sexual orientation.
    *   **12** concluded that it is **ineffective and/or harmful**
        *   These studies found links to **depression, suicidality, anxiety, social isolation and decreased capacity for intimacy.**
    *   Only one study found positive results; however, researchers note that this study involved bad data and was biased in its use of self-identified religious subjects.
    *   The remaining 34 studies found null results.
        *   Much of the info we have on conversion therapy is self-reported, so the data has certain limitations.
