## Murders and Attacks

#### Right-wing terror and the rise of white nationalism are the current biggest terrorist threats in the United States, constituting a majority of domestic terrorist cases.



*   [ADL 18](https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017)
    *   The number of white supremacist murders in the United States **more than doubled** in 2017 compared to the previous year
    *   This **far surpasses** murders committed by domestic Islamic extremists and making 2017 the **fifth deadliest year** on record for **extremist violence** since 1970.

    *   Heat map documenting extremist attacks from 2002-2019.
    *   Surprise! A **vast** majority of attacks are motivated by some sort of “**right-wing**” cause.
    *   In 2019, there has been 1 “left-wing” attack. In 2018, there were reportedly **zero**.

    *   A different analysis based on statistics from the United States Extremist Crime Database which includes foreign and domestic terrorism.
    *   _"The total number of fatalities is about the same for far right wing violent extremists and radical Islamist violent extremists over the approximately 15-year period (106 and 119, respectively)."_
    *   _“There were **no attacks** since 1990 by persons associated with extreme leftist ideologies that resulted in fatalities to non-perpetrators.”_

    *   A fact check of the ADL statistics (hint: they’re accurate)
        *   The Daily Caller News Foundation (a right-wing news organization founded by Tucker Carlson) conducted an independent analysis of domestic extremism for the same 10-year time frame as the ADL.
        *   _“Our findings **support the ADL statistic**. Using their definition of right-wing extremists, we found that **92 percent of ideologically motivated homicide** incidents were committed with a right-wing extremist or white supremacist motive.”_
    *   Data is based on START homicide statistics
    *   Here’s a basic summary:
