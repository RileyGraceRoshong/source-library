This is an expanded edition of Vaush's Ultimate Research Document, which outlines academic and scientific literature opposed to any and all forms of reactionary rhetoric, along with logical and empirically founded argumentation and a few helpful thinkpieces.

This document is pretty big so I recommend using the outline! (view -> show document outline)
