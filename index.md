This repository is a more organized version of my main [factsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UhneOJvvO9vzHIUWfgKWJCCFi0LDNj_3p6LGBkIo6mU/edit?usp=sharing), which outlines academic and scientific literature opposed to any and all forms of reactionary rhetoric, along with logical and empirically founded argumentation and a few helpful thinkpieces. You can easily navigate to any topic using the links below.
